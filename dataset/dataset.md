## Datadaset Construction Pipeline
### Data Collection and Filtering
- **Sources**: Content was gathered from YouTube 360 videos, focusing on panoramic videos in virtual city tours, wildlife documentaries, and VR game captures. We manually filter out low-quality 360 videos with bad polar patterns and frequent human appearances.

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Shot Segmentation**: Videos were *downsampled by x2*, segmented into 100-frame, fps20 clips with TransNetV2 and FFmpeg. If a video exceeds 40000 frames, we further downsample x3 and keep the first 20000 frames.
- **Motion Filtering**: Panoflow was used to filter clips based on motion.
- **Text Annotation**: VideoLLaMa2 annotated clips with content information.
- **Content Filtering**: Remove semantic duplicates based on text captions.

## Dataset Overview
### YouTube360
The `YouTube360` dataset consists of 9557 video clips curated from online 360 videos. Each data sample includes metadata on YouTubeID, videoID, captions, timestamps, originalFPS and TotalFrames. Please note the time duration of each clip is x2 times longer as we downsample each frame by x2. 

### Data Fields
The [`dataset/youtube360.csv`](youtube360.csv) file contains the following columns:
- **youtubeid**: The YouTube ID of the original video, e.g., 2Lq86MKesG4. The source video url can found at  `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={youtubeid}`.
- **videoid**: The original video ID and corresponding splitting ID, with a format such as `2Lq86MKesG4_clip_0_019`.
- **caption**: Text caption summarizing each video clip.
- **tstart**: The start time of the video segment in seconds in original fps.
- **tend**: The end time of the video segment in original fps.
- **fps**: The fps of the original video.
- **totalframes**: The total number of frames in original video.

### Example Data Entry
| YouTubeID | VideoID | Caption | tStart | tEnd | FPS | TotalFrames |
|------|---------------| -----------| ------------|----------|-----|----------|
| 2Lq86MKesG4 | 2Lq86MKesG4_clip_0_019 | "a busy city street with cars, buses, and tall buildings. The street is wet, and the video is taken from a car's point of view." | 690.9 | 700.9 | 20.0| 26450.0 |
